# ICD codes lookup
This depository includes a lookup table for the international classification of diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes I produced while while working as a research assistant. I found that there was a frustrating lack of easy official tabulated ICD-codes, and in particular, which converted the old deprecated ICD-9 codes to the currently used ICD-10 codes. 

As such, I upload here the lookup tables I generated for exactly this purpose - to have a tabulated version of the codes, which allows each code to be easily categorised into several condition categories and subcategories, as well as, where possible, being converted backwards and forwards from/to ICD-9 and ICD-10.

I also upload the regex code I wrote in Python to tabulate the pdf version of the code definitions and classification, which the WHO provide. 

NOTE that the tabulation is no doubt imperfect, and I am sure the regex could be improved, but I felt this might be a useful starting point at least for someone in a similar position as I was, and save them some time and effort on what is ultimately a very menial and frustrating roadblock to working with health data.
